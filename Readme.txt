thank you for downloading Hunger games V2 map to use this map there are several ways.

firstly and most simply creat a LAN server and play with people who are on your network to do this.

to do this you must first add this map to your siggle player to do this simly copy the folder contained in this .zip
and put it inder %appdata%/.minecraft/saves. then you need to open it to lan.

To open your current single player world for other players in your LAN, type the command /publish into the chat 
(note that this is still very restricted, e.g. you can't adjust the game options using the commandline) or access 
the Game Menu and click on the "Open to LAN" button. There you can select the gamemode for other players and whether they should be allowed to use Cheats. Both of these methods give you an IP for use, for example: "Local game hosted on hostname:12345". If you type /publish and want to change the default gamemode, type /defaultgamemode 1 for example. Note: two computers using the same Minecraft account name cannot connect with this method.
Now other players can either connect to your game using the link minecraft provided you or they can connect using
 the multiplayer menu with its new "Scanning for LAN-Worlds" section at the bottom.

secondly you can open a sever if you hvent got one already, there are several wasy to do this, such as hamatchi, for
small private servers, portforwarding or even buying a server slot, eiether way google is your freind.

thanks again :) enjoy
